This will be my first project, my goal is to create a mountain bike shopping tool. Please see below for more details:

1. Identify your user(s)
  Individuals shopping for mountain bikes
  
2. What is the problem you’re solving?
  It is often difficult to keep track of the different bikes on the market and what bikes you’ve found that will be the best fit for you. My goal is to make mountain bike shopping easier and more accessible to more people.
  
3. What is the solution?
  A mountain bike shopping organizing tool will help bikers with their shopping/research process. It will allow users to populate their list of the bikes that they’ve: been researching online, ridden/tested in stores, or demoed out on the trails. 
  
4. What is the MVP scope? (core features you must get working)
  To get a basic to-do list style functionality working, where i can: create new bikes, read new bikes, update current bikes, and delete bikes
  
5. What are the tough technical challenges involved with solving this problem?
  Understanding frontend and backend basics to the point where I can create such an application
  
6. What are the stretch goals?
  To be able to add additional detail elements onto the bikes such as suspension info, wheel size info, and other data to help bikers filter through their choices. Eventually, I would like a database full of bikes where bikers can choose their parameters such as price, suspension lengths, types of trails they’d like to ride, and the program will  list out bikes that would match those parameters.
